# About AoC

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 

People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

For more details take a look to the [Advent of code website](https://adventofcode.com/2024/).
